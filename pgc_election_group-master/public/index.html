      <h2>What's the information problem?</h2>
      <p>Even though the voting process is crucial to determining the leaders of our communities, states, and country; the voting turn out in most communities is under 50%.
          Many people are not taught how the voting process and elections work. PGC Election Hub strives to address voting withing Prince George's County elections by educating voters about the voting process through an interactive sample ballot, simulations,
          and candidate information all accessible in one place! </p>

      <h2>Who can benefit from improvements?</h2>
      <p>Any PG County citizens, ages 18 and up can benefit from this website. Additionally, we have found that young people between the ages of 18-29 make
        up a large population of non-voters. We especially hope to reach young voters, since they have statiscally had lower voting turnouts.

        <p>This resource was created in order to aid in the process of
          informing inexperienced and uneducated voters about the voting process.
          Here, you can find a guide to the different parts of the website, that
          will help orient you. Here are the specific functionalities you will
          see on the site:

      <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="w3-button w3-margin-right"
      onclick="openNav()"><h2 id="navInfo">Navigation Bar</h2>
    </a>
      <p>The navigation bar serves to help you find your way around the site.
        You will see there are four sections to our navigation bar. These
        sections are home, about, ballot, and documentation. Clicking "Home"
        will take you to the top of our page. Clicking "About" will take you to
        the about section of our website. This section will give you a better
        idea of what our website's purpose is and who it is meant for. Clicking
        "Ballot" will take you to the section of our website that holds all the
        main functionalities of our website. You will be able to scroll through
        and find the ballot candidate table, the translation button, the search
        bar, the polling places list, the vote count simulator, and the ballot
        bubble simulator. Finally, clicking "Documentation" will take you to the
        part of our website with any instructions one would need to use the site.
      </p>
      <a href="#ballot" class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">
        <h2 id="ballotInfo">Ballot Candidate Table</h2>
      </a>
        <p>In the Ballot Candidate table, you will find all of the candidates
          running for office, as they would appear in the ballot. You will also
          see their political party. You will see that they are separated by the
          position that there are running for. You can scroll within this box
          the same as you would for any page. You can click on some of the
          elements in this box for more resources. For instance, you can click
          on the position title, for information about what that position is and
          what they do. You can also click on any candidate to navigate to that
          candidate's page. You will also see a write in input box in this
          section. This is meant to appear as it would on a real ballot, but it
          is not meant to be submitted. At this point in time, link
          functionality is not in place for the Spanish version of the ballot.
          All ballot data contained on this site reflects the 2018 Gubernatorial
          Ballot in the state of Maryland.

      <h2><a href="#trans" title="Go to translation button"
        class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">Translation Button</a></h2>
      <p>The translation button allows you to see the candidate table in
        spanish. This functionality is quite simple. You will see a button over
        the ballot candidate table with the prompt, "Haga clic para traducir la
        boleta al Español." Clicking this will allow you to see all of the
        candidates and titles in spanish. Once translated to Spanish, the
        button will appear with the text, "Click to translate ballot to English";
        once clicked the ballot will revert to the English version.

      <h2><a href="#filter" title="Go to table search box"
        class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">Search Bar</a></h2>
      <p>The search bar is meant to search through all of the polling places in
        Prince George's County. If you know of a polling place in the county,
        you can type it in to the search bar, and it will display all of the
        relevant places in the search. If what you type in does not match a
        polling place on the list, nothing will show up.
      </p>
      <h2 id="tableInfo"><a href="#table" title="Go to polling place table"
      class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">Polling Places List</a></h2>
      <p>The polling place lists all of the polling places available in Prince
        George's county. Each place has a District/Precinct number, location
        name, Address, City, Zip Code, and number of Ballots. As seen previously,
        the polling places are searchable through the search bar above.
        Additionally, the list is filterable. Clicking any of the headings at
        the top of the list will give you a different filter. Clicking "Dist/Prec"
        will list all of the places based on the district and precinct. Clicking
        "Polling Place" will sort all of the places by name alphabetically.
        Clicking "Address" will sort everything by address. Cicking city will
        sort all places by city. Clicking by Zip will sort all polling places by
        zip code. Finally, clicking ballot will sort places by number of ballots.
      </p>
      <h2 id="toolInfo"><a href="#electionSim" title="Go to election simulator"
      class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">Vote Count Simulator</a></h2>
      <p>The Voting Count Simulator is a resource that is publically provided
        by ncase and company. This resource allows you to play arounf and
        illustrate how a candidate wins an election over other candidates.
        As you move the different shapes around, you will find that their
        respective colors will cover different areas of the square. The area
        covered by colors simulates how many votes a candidate has. You will be
        able to see a numerical representation of this at the bottom. This will
        illustrate that the candidate who has the most color, or most votes, will
        win.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bubbleInfo"><a href="#sim-fill" title="Go to bubble simulator"
      class="w3-bar-item w3-button w3-hover-white">Ballot Bubble Simulator</a></h2>
      <p>The Ballot Bubble Simulator is meant to practice fillin in the bubbles
        that you will find when voting. As you hold your screen over the box,
        you will see a pencil appear. You can hold down the mouse and drag
        through the box to fill in the inner circle. If you fill in correctly,
        the box will turn green. If you overfill or underfill, the box will turn
        red. You can reset the box by pressing the reset button located to the
        right of the box.

        <p>I had a great time working on this project and excercising skills
          learned in web development this semester. I am looking forward to
          graduating in the Spring of 2020 and hope to make a career with and
          continually build upon the things I have learned at the University of
          Maryland. Coding and development is something I have come to really
          enjoy. I would love working in teams, and really enjoyed seeing what
          came together for us in this project. I hope that anyone viewing the
          page pays close attention to the navigation and would love to see
          someone use parts of our project for functional tools or graphic

      <h2>Ayesha Raza</h2>
        <p>It was an amazing experience working in a group environment in this project.
            I was able to help resolve group issues through research and communication.
            Also, I was able to apply the concept I have learned in the class and
            was able to build a working website to resolve the information problem.
            I worked on writing the reports, presentation, and overall design of the website
            using my skills learned in the class using HTML and CSS. There were times where
            we were not sure to integrate some of the concepts into our project.
            For instance, playing with iframes was a struggle as it would look different in both
            desktop and mobile versions. However, working as a group helped us accomplish our
            goals. We as a team were able to create a website to help prepare voters with general
            information and digital ballots that are more informative and helpful in assisting the
            preparation of users with limited accessibility intending to vote. </br>

      <h2>Tony Persaud</h2>
        <p>This was an amazing project to work on. I truly enjoyed the learning moments that came
          with working on a large, hands-on project such as this in a group fashion. While it was daunting
          at times, it was very rewarding, being able to learn from my peers at this accelerated pace. At the
          beginning of this semester, I did not have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JS. The nature
          of this project has given me confidence to actively pursue projects such as this for future endeavors.
          While our successes taught me a lot during this project, I learned a lot from the failures we endured.
          I gained experience in diagnosing where issues are, through massive amounts of code. Additionally, I
          discovered resources that I will undoubtedly use for the rest of my career.
