In the Ballot Candidate table, you will find all of the candidates running for office, as they would appear in the ballot. You will also see their political party. You will see that they are separated by the position that there are running for. You can scroll within this box the same as you would for any page. You can click on some of the elements in this box for more resources. For instance, you can click on the position title, for information about what that position is and what they do. You can also click on any candidate to navigate to that candidate's page. You will also see a write in input box in this section. This is meant to appear as it would on a real ballot, but it is not meant to be submitted. At this point in time, link functionality is not in place for the Spanish version of the ballot. All ballot data contained on this site reflects the 2018 Gubernatorial Ballot in the state of Maryland.

Once translated to Spanish, the button will appear with the text, "Click to translate ballot to English"; once clicked the ballot will revert to the English version.
